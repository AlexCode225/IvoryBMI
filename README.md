# IvoryBMI
BMI app is a handy tool that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index based on their height and weight. It’s a widely used measure of body fat and provides insights into an individual’s health status.
Users can input their height and weight in either metric or imperial units, and the app instantly computes their BMI. Additionally, it often includes a health status indicator, such as “underweight,” “normal weight,” “overweight,” or “obese,” to help users understand their overall health based on the calculated BMI.
